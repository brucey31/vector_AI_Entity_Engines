# Vector AI Entity Engine
## Setup
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`
* `brew install enchant`

## Notes
I have created this in a jupyter notebook that will serve best to show my thinking around each of the steps and each engine to recognise and categorise each string or short phrase. To view the file you can either open it with `jupyter notebook` or read the PDF file that has been generated for you to read.

##### N.B.
I have spent a couple of hours on this and is by no means a perfect solution that can be used for all new strings or different types and formats. The idea of this work is to show my thinking on how I would go about working through this solution and I have added addition next steps along the way to show where I would go if I was doing more work on it.
